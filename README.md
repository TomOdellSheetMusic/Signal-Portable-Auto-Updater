# Signal-Portable-Auto-Updater

### A simple batch script to automatically update Signal Portable.
Since the Signal Portable App from Portapps does not update correctly, here is an easy script for you to use.

## Requirements 
A <a href="https://github.com/portapps/signal-portable">Signal Portable</a> instance from PortApps. <br>

## IMPORTANT
The update button in the top left corner will NOT WORK. You need to run this script in order to update. This is a quirk of Signal Portable, not the script. <br>

## Usage 

Simply put the batch folder into wherever you have your Signal Portable instance. This can also be done by extracting the zip from the Releases Tab. <br>
The batch folder needs to be on the same level as the app, data and log folders. The icon file is in case you want to make a shortcut to your start menu and want it to look nicer.
